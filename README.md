# ICPC-Regional-INC 2025
Prob I:
You are given a land grid of size N x M, which consists of two types of cells: water pools (.) and land (#). The goal of this problem is to check whether the pools formed (connected components of water) maintain a rectangular shape after each change in the grid.
Rectangular Pool Rule:
1. Rectangular Pool: A pool formed by water (.) must have a rectangular shape. This means that every water cell in the pool must lie within a fully filled rectangular area.
2. After each change (where one cell changes from . to # or vice versa), we need to check if all existing pools still maintain their rectangular shape.

Prob: A, E, F, K using Kotlin
